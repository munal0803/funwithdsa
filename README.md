# FUN WITH DSA 
# Data Structures and Algorithms
Many a time student face difficulty to understand why should one learn Data structure and Algorithm, by this project we want to make students feel the importance of DSA in day to day life.
We have implemented various data structures and used various algorithm to make projects that help student to understand the importance of DSA in real world.

Project 1

*TIC TAC TOE*

We have developed never losing tic tac toe game, which uses minmax Algorithm which is based on recursion.
This game is developed using Javastript, CSS and HTML
Algo used: MINmax Algorithm

Project 2

*Meeting schedular*

Many A time team faces difficulty to find approriate time slot to fix meeting. This website takes free time slot of every team member and find the time slot in which all team member are free.
Algo used: Greedy Approach

Project 3
*PostFix to Inflix*
